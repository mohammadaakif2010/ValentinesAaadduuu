                  I want you to listen to me once, calmly, without fear or pressure. This is not a complaint or an argument. This is just me explaining what we were, what we became, and why I am still standing here.
<br><br>
When we first met, we were both new students. Quiet. Not very social. That’s why we became close so easily. I still remember meeting you outside the activity room after the summer vacation, waiting for our ID card photographs. Everything started simply and honestly.
<br><br>
You had just come out of a breakup. You took me with you everywhere, and at that time, I didn’t question anything. I was just there for you.
<br><br>
One night, lying on my bunk bed and staring at the blue light of an adapter, I realized I had fallen in love with you. It wasn’t planned. It just happened.
<br><br>
On 10 November 2023, I gathered all my courage and proposed to you. The next day was Bal Mela. That same evening, you asked me what you should wear under your pink top, and I suggested dark blue jeans. On 11 November, when I saw you in formals at Bal Mela, the feeling was unexplainable. That moment still lives with me.
<br><br>
On 17 November 2023, you told me we couldn’t be together because of caste differences — you being Hindu and me being Muslim. I understood how heavy that was. Still, I waited.
<br><br>
On your birthday, 8 July 2024, I proposed again. You said, “I love you too, as a friend.” That broke me, but I stayed, because my feelings didn’t suddenly disappear.
<br><br>
On my birthday, 20 July 2024, you gave me a small, beautiful foldable table lamp. I still have it. Even now, when I see its light, it reminds me of how quietly you were present in my life, even when we weren’t together.
<br><br>
On 2 August 2024, you gave me that black friendship band. I kept it with me always. I held onto it like a promise. Even when it broke, I felt guilty, as if I had failed to protect something important. Recently, I lost it, and that loss hit me harder than I expected. It brought back a deep guilt, not because of the band itself, but because of what it meant to me.
<br><br>
When you were leaving school, on my last exam day, I wanted to celebrate with you. I was fasting because of Ramadan, so I let the moment pass. I wanted to hug you, but I didn’t. I chose respect over impulse.
<br><br>
We stayed friends. We kept talking.
<br><br>
You came back to visit on 27 November 2025 near Navratri. Later, on 2 October 2025, I proposed again. When you said yes, I was honestly in shock. I couldn’t believe it. On 3 October, when you wished me “Boyfriend Day,” that’s when it finally felt real to me.
<br><br>
For a while, we were genuinely happy.

Then things slowly changed. Replies became late. Reels stopped. Conversations turned dry. On 24 December 2025, your maternal aunt — who is herself an astrologer — found out about us. Because we belong to different castes, the relationship was opposed, and you were asked to end it.

That day broke me completely. I cried in front of my entire family. I didn’t hide anything. Instead of stopping me, they supported me. They stood by me. That’s how real this was for me.

Even after everything ended, I stayed. We kept talking. Asking about food, about our days. But inside, I was hurting.
<br><br>
“Wo hokar bhi nahi hai.”<br>
“Aisi zindagi ka kya, jisme tum zindagi mein hokar meri zindagi na ban sako.”<br>
<br><br>
On 4 February, I proposed again. Not because I don’t understand reality, but because my feelings were still true. You said you need time.
<br><br>
I am not asking you to fight your family alone. I am not asking for impulsive decisions. I am asking you to look at the consistency, the respect, and the honesty with which I loved you. I never treated this as a phase.

Some things are not measured by how easy they are, but by how sincerely they are held.

I am still here, not to pressure you, but to tell you this clearly: I didn’t love you for moments. I loved you for the long run.
<br><br>
And if even a small part of you feels that this was real — not just emotion, but something rare — then don’t close the door yet. Let’s not let fear be the only thing that decides our story.
<br><br>
<b>Please reply back on reading it on whatsapp, and if you feel uneasy leave it. But really I genuinely LOVE YOU.</b>
